# stack_overflow_public_reports
This is a collection of the reports I either contributed to or wrote solely while I held the position of Senior Consultant on the Insights team at Stack Overflow.

The 'Developer Ecosystem' reports were produced on a quarterly basis. They featured analysis from several of Stack Overflow's proprietary data sources, including the 2017 Annual Developer Survey. The geographical focus of these reports were the UK and Ireland.

The 'NYC Talent Mapping report' is a public example of the besoke reports the Insights team were commissioned to produce, predominantly by tier one tech and finance companies. We used proprietary population data from our machine learning platform to help companies answer business questions regarding the location and concentration of specific developer types.

The 'Amazon white paper' is one example of co-branded white papers written on a variety of subjects; this particular one being on how best to launch mobile apps in an overcrowded market place.
